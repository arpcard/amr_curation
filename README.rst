AMR Curation 
--------------------------------------------

**Actively monitored by the CARD Curation Team.**

A number of databases and software tools exist for DNA sequence-based investigation of antimicrobial resistance (see `Boolchandani, D'Souza, & Dantas. 2019. Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance. Nat Rev Genet <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0108-4>`_). We encourage researchers, software developers, and AMR data curators to use this repository to submit, discuss, and resolve AMR curation issues. Anyone with a GitHub account can `submit an issue <https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation/issues>`_. AMR software developers or database curators are welcome to join the repository as `Contributors <https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation/graphs/contributors>`_ to share files, data, & code as well as add documentation (send request to card@mcmaster.ca or `submit a GitHub issue <https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation/issues>`_).

If you are `submitting a question or correction <https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation/issues>`_ about AMR data in a particular database, please indicate the database in your submission. If your question or issue is about software, please use the software's own repository or email address to report the problem.

We also maintain the `amr_curation-l <https://mailman.mcmaster.ca/mailman/listinfo/amr_curation-l>`_ email mailing list for discussion of AMR curation issues if you prefer to this over GitHub. Lastly, we maintain some online resources, please help us keep these up to date:

* `Wikipedia's list of Antimicrobial Resistance databases <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases#Antimicrobial_resistance_databases>`_
* `Google Spreadsheet of AMR Databases and Software <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1psHogF0rZIIq9AXbFfjQNYVXoOVHEYPOi9CYLvtO04U/edit?usp=sharing>`_
