AMR Curation 
--------------------------------------------

**Actively monitored by the CARD Curation Team.**

We encourage researchers, software developers, and AMR data curators to use this repository to submit, discuss, and resolve AMR curation issues at the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database and beyond. Anyone with a GitHub account can `submit an issue <https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation/issues>`_. If an issue is specific to CARD, assign to @arpcard. If an issue is specific to NCBI, assign to @danielhhaft.

We also maintain the `amr_curation-l <https://mailman.mcmaster.ca/mailman/listinfo/amr_curation-l>`_ email mailing list for discussion of AMR curation issues if you prefer email over GitHub. 

Lastly, 1-on-1 conversations with the CARD curators can also occur via email to card@mcmaster.ca.

We maintain some online resources as well, please help us keep these up to date:

* `Wikipedia's list of Antimicrobial Resistance databases <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases#Antimicrobial_resistance_databases>`_
* `Google Spreadsheet of AMR Databases and Software <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1psHogF0rZIIq9AXbFfjQNYVXoOVHEYPOi9CYLvtO04U/edit?usp=sharing>`_
