AMR Curation 
--------------------------------------------

**Actively monitored by the CARD Curation Team.**

A number of databases and software tools exist for DNA sequence-based investigation of antimicrobial resistance (see `Boolchandani, D'Souza, & Dantas. 2019. Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance. Nat Rev Genet <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0108-4>`_). We encourage researchers, software developers, and AMR data curators to use this repository to submit, discuss, and resolve AMR curation issues. Anyone with a GitHub account can submit an issue. AMR software developers or database curators are welcome to join the repository as `Contributors <https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation/graphs/contributors>`_ to share files, data, & code as well as add documentation (send request to card@mcmaster.ca).

If you are submitting a question or correction about AMR data in a particular database, please indicate the database in your submission. If your question or issue is about software, please use the software's own repository or email address to report the problem.
